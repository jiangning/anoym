A note by anonymous

Anoym.com is a notebook for recording things you want to publish for making warning or tips to people about something BAD.

People can use this notebook to check the things(names, events, etc...) that appear in the note other people marked here for reference and consultation

It might have incorrect information to you such as vilipend or rumor. To avoid this situation, you can post your opinion or view on what other people said for others to get relatively objective evaluations as much as possible.

No register, no personal information collection, no spy, that is the reason made anoym put all source code on Github.

Letâ€™s build a pure, free and transparent information platform.
